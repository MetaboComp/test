## General description
The MUVR package allows for predictive multivariate modelling with minimally biased variable selection incorporated into a repeated double cross-validation framework. The MUVR procedure simultaneously produces both minimal-optimal and all-relevant variable selections.

An easy-to-follow tutorial on how to use the MUVR package for classification, regression and multilevel analysis can be found at this repository at [Tutorial/MUVR_Tutorial.docx] (https://gitlab.com/CarlBrunius/MUVR/blob/master/Tutorial/MUVR_Tutorial.docx)

In brief, MUVR proved the following functionality:
- Types: Classification, regression and multilevel
- Model cores: PLS and Random Forest
- Validation: Repeated double cross-validaiton (rdCV; Westerhuis et al 2008, Filzmoser et al 2009)
- Variable selection: Recursive feature elimination embedded in the rdCV loop.  

## Installation
- You will need to have installed R (https://www.r-project.org/)
- Normally, you will want to work in RStudio (https://rstudio.com/) or some other IDE

You also need to have the `remotes` R package installed. Just run the following from an R script or type it directly at the R console (normally the lower left window in RStudio):
```
install.packages('remotes')
```
When `remotes` is installed, you can install the `MUVR` package by running:
```
library(remotes)
install_gitlab('CarlBrunius/MUVR')
```

In addition to functions relevant for crossvalidated, predictive multivariate modelling, the MUVR package also provides data to accurately reproduce figures from the original *Shi et al* paper (below).
